## Project Description
This project is part of the Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering, in the 2nd year, 2nd semester of the academic year 2022/2023. The objective is to develop a Java program composed of multiple Wrappers that retrieve data from heterogeneous, distributed, and autonomous sources, allowing the user to visualize and search that data in an integrated manner. The program should also allow the addition of new data and the generation of files with selected information.

## Objectives
The objectives of this work are:

1. Analyze a typical Data Integration situation and propose valid approaches for a functional, effective, and correct integration model.
2. Create and manipulate XML.
3. Use regular expressions.
4. Perform information searches in XML files using XPath and/or XQuery.
5. Perform transformations of XML files using XSLT and/or XQuery.
6. Validate XML files using DTD and/or XSD.

## Data Sources
The data sources used in this project are:
- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/)
- [Bertrand](https://www.bertrand.pt/)

## Main Tasks
The main tasks to be developed in this practical work are:

1. Analyze the data sources and identify where to find information about writers and their works.
2. Define the global schema for data collection, based on two XML files with the appropriate structure.
3. Implement Wrappers using regular expressions to retrieve relevant information from each data source.
4. Generate and manipulate XML files, adding, editing, and deleting data.
5. Validate the global model using XSD and/or DTD.
6. Perform XPath searches to allow the user to search for information in the unified view.
7. Generate output files using XSLT and/or XQuery transformations.
8. Create a user-friendly and intuitive graphical interface for the application.
